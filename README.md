## Jets Project

* Skill Distillery Week 2 Homework

### Description
This project simulates an airfield.
There are different types of planes with different abilities (cargo or fighter).
The program demonstrates each ability for each plane based on user request.
The user can also ask for a list of the planes in the airfield to be displayed.
The user can also begin a dogfight between all the jets and see which one survives.
After a dogfight, the last jet is the only jet left in the airfield.


### Technologies Used
* Java
* Java Classes and Interfaces

### Lessons Learned
* How to have a user add to an array and subclass
* How to randomize interactions between subclasses
* How to iterate through an array
* How to utilize Interfaces
* Why abstract classes need subclasses that implement their methods.
